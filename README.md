# ME0021---Mechanics-II

This repository includes Python code for the ME0021 Mechanisms Models project phase 2A: Mathematical models. 

My mechanism was #145. This mathematical model shows the linear velocity of point B in relation to phi as a function of t. The user may input any function of t into phi and run the program. For sampling, a function has already been inputted to phi which results in an increasing sinusoidal graph for the velocity at B.
